This are some asthetic poems

Poems are asthetic
Poems are deep

***********

Let chaos be a storm!
Let cloud shapes like swarm!
I will wait on you.

************

This life to turn me into 
savage
And the devil try to ell me that
I'm average
And the pressure try to put me in
a casket
I went dianmond, 24 karat

************
I will grow
Despite
The horror
That feed upon
My tomorow

*************

Write your poetry on my skin,
Make love to my mindwith your diction, 
Spill your ink across my body,
And put me back to life.

poem is an amazing way of expressing feelings in words
